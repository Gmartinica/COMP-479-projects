'
own
long-term

was
responding
to
a
question
about
what
the

could
do
to
encourage
appreciation
of
those

against
the
dollar
in
order
to
reduce
the
large

trade
deficits

its
per

trade
surplus
with
the
U.S.
larger
than

of

's

was
difficult

the
high

tarrifs

other

that
prevail

Dauster

Brazil
now
had

its

plans
and
that
the
15.5
mln

export
figure
which
it
had
proposed
for
itself
earlier
should
no
longer
be
taken
as
the

's

15.5

offer
had
been
made
on
the
assumption
an
agreement
would
bring
stability
to
world
markets
added
had
been
a
gesture
to
ease
negotiations
the
lack
of
an

leaves
it
no

valid
and
exports
could
be
above

below
15.5

said
said
he
would
talk
to
producers
and
market
analysts
before
taking
any
decision
on
export
policy
any
future
policy
would
be
flexible
and
adjusted
to
market
conditions
We
will
not
take
any
short-term
decisions
which
might
cause
markets
to
panic
Dauster
added
said
it
would
be
a
policy
which
shows
Brazil
has
coffee
to
sell
and
that
it
could
do
so
without
an
ICO
agreement
Brazil
has
coffee

wants
to
show
that
it
does
not
need
an
ICO
agreement
as
a
crutch
Dauster
said
on
the
breakdown
of
the
talks
said
consumer
proposals
would
have
implied
a
reduction
of
one

two
mln

in
Brazil
's
export
quotas
It
was
a
proposal
which
would
lead
to
a
substantial
loss
for
Brazil
and
which
would
be
difficult
for
the
country
to
recover
he
said
consumer
proposal
to
base
quotas
on
a
six-year
moving
average
of
exportable
production

would
lead

diplomats
said
the

the
wound
was
despite
a

of
Britain
's
budget
contribution
to
reflect
its
inability
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
EC
's
farm
subsidies
system
because
of
the
relatively
small
size
of
its
agricultural
sector
said
although
other
nations
such
as
Italy
and
the
Netherlands
were
certain
to
oppose
elements
in
the
system
which
could
also
substantially
increase
their
own
EC
payments
main
opposition
was
expected
from
Britain
Minister
Margaret
Thatcher
has
made
clear
in

two-thirds
of

The

created
by

mania

distressing
Shad
said
the
recent
cases
involving
Ivan
Boesky
Levine
and

was
a
warning
that
those
who
engage
in
insider
trading
were
taking
a
heavy
risk
of
imprisonment
fines
and
disbarment
from
the
securities
industry
Insider
trading
has
not
been
eradicated
it
has
been
inhibited
and
multimillions
of
dollars
of
profits
that
Boesky
and
others
have
been
siphoning
off
the

are
now
flowing

insider

cases

only
10

less

Reagan

22

a

A
study
of
salmonella
poisoning
has
uncovered
new
evidence
that
the
common
practice
of
feeding
antibiotics
to
cattle
is
helping
to
create
deadly
bacteria
that
can
infect
humans
and
resist
medicines
at
the
federal
Centers
for
Disease
Control
tracked
the
spread
of
an
unusual
strain
of
salmonella
that
is
resistant
to
the
drug
chloramphenicol
and
were
able
to
link
the
resulting
food
poisoning
to
farms
that
used
the
drug
to
promote
the
growth
of
cattle
often
give
their
animals
a
constant
supply
of
antibiotics
in
feed
to
help
them
grow
faster
critics
have
been
warning
for
years
that
the
constant
exposure
to
the
drugs
is
helping
bacteria
learn
to
resist
the
drugs
officials
have
disputed
this
the
diseases
that
develop
a
resistance
in
cattle

do

there
had
been

by

because
at

that
the

analysts
and
industry
leaders
have
questioned
central
bank
policy
of
pegging
the
guilder
firmly
to
the
mark
and
if
necessary
keeping
interest
rates
up
to
support
the
guilder
federation
NCW
chairman
Fred
Lempers
criticised
the
guilder
's
revaluation
in
line
with
the
West
German
mark
in
last
January
's
European
Monetary
System
and
expressed
concern
over
its
effect
on
competitiveness
the
employers
federation
VNO
noted
the
Dutch
economy
had
become
more
competitive
since
1980
and
the
fall
of
the
dollar
was
affecting
this
gain
more
than
the
EMS
realignment
analysts
also
question
the
central
bank
's
decision
not
to
copy
the
latest
Bundesbank
discount
rate
cut
and
instead
lower
money
market
rates
and
abolish
a
credit
quota
surcharge
bank
president
Wim
Duisenberg
has
defended
the
move
saying
the
bank
had
adjusted
the
rates
with
the
most
impact
on
the
money
market
pct
rate
is
at
the
moment
not
the
most
important
Dutch
rate
because
it
is
already
far
below
the
market
rates
Central
bank
officials
say
the
heavy
dependence
on
trade
of
the
Dutch
economy
requires
a
stable
exchange
rate
interest
rate
policies
serve
that
goal
noted
a
large
capital
outflow
from
the
Netherlands
recently
as
foreign
investments
in
Dutch
stock
are
being
sold
to
take
profits
the
tie
between
the
guilder
and
the
mark
would
reduce
international
confidence
in
the
guilder
and
make
it
more
dificult
to
attract
foreign
capital
said
Dutch
interest
rates
rose
sharply
when
the
guilder
was
not
revalued
completely
in
line
with
the
mark
in
a
1983

realignment
Dutch
banks
have

add

he
favoured

that

Ruding
wanted
to
bring

down

The

again
fought
against

bond
market
pressure
for

take
the

which
offers
high
relative
returns
and
the

gains
said
is
divided
over
whether
the
Bank
can
stop
a
cut
before
Budget
Day
17
why
it
should
want
to
Bank
's
latest
strong
signal
to
the
market
that
it
wants
rates
to
stay
steady
for
the
moment
came
in
midafternoon
it
lent
to
the
discount
houses
at
a
penal
rate
of
11-3/4

making

suffer
said
Stephen
Lewis
at

Phillips
and
Drew
Eleven
and
three-quarters
pct
is
way
above

market
rates
This
money
market
signal
was
apparently
not
accompanied
by
any
sterling
sales
on
the
foreign
exchanges
of
which
had
inhibited
strong
rises
yesterday
and
Tuesday
buyers
came
strongly
into
the

pound

London
close
from
the
previous
finish
at
1.5650/60
2.8900/60

If
this
pressure
keeps
up
is
a
possibility
that

could
drop
before
the
Budget
said
Jeremy

at

rate
from

as
early
as
tomorrow
said
the
Bank
of
England
will
need
to
be
convinced
that
the
present
rise
is
a
fundamental
re-rating
rather
than
a
result
of
short-term
speculative
gains
are
valid
reasons
for
the
Bank
to
be
cautious
Peter

at

that
the

yet
prove

to

price
losses
or
a
change
of

for

agree
the
Bank
is
largely
trying
to
set
the
timing
of
a

than
holding
out

altogether
authorities
traditionally
prefer
a
single
sustainable
rate
move
way
or
the
other
half

here
and
there
add
the

be
influenced
by
signs
that
at

a
proportion
of
the
latest
bout
of
sterling
buying
is
long-term
capital
coming
into
the
London

that
the

as
a
safer

But

he
added

declined
to
comment
on

sources

the

see
the

Commission
Chairman
John
Shad
said
the
SEC
favors
shortening
the
current
10-day
period
for
disclosing
takeover
attempts
but
opposes
putting
restrictions
on
the
use
of
so-called
junk

We
favor
shortening
the
disclosure
period
to
two
days
Shad
told
members
of
the
House
Telecommunications
and
Finance
subcommittee
when
asked
for
his
recommendation
said
the
SEC
's
responsibility
was
to
provide
full
disclosure
for

junk
bonds
not
to
make

merit
said
junk

Tool

Chairman
W.A
said
its
counter
proposal
to
merge
with
Baker
International
Corp
was
still
under
consideration
and
that
a
merger
was
in
the
best
interests
of
both
companies
Our
hope
is
that
we
can
come
to
a
mutual
agreement
that
is
good
for
both
companies
Kistler
said
of
the
proposed
merger
that
would
result
in
a
1.2
billion
dlr
oil
field
service
company
We
're
working
very
hard
on
this
merger
Hughes
'
board
today
again
adjourned
a
shareholders
meeting
to
vote
on
the
proposed
merger
and
rescheduled
it
for
March
11
to
give
Baker
more
time
to
consider
the
counter
proposal
Hughes
board
had
previously
expressed
concern
about
a
U.S.
Department
of
Justice
consent
decree
that
would
require
Baker
to
sell
its
drilling
bit
operations
and
submersible
pump
business
yesterday
and
threatened
to
terminate
the
proposed
merger
Hughes
board
made
a
counter
proposal
that
the
two
companies
first
find
acceptable
buyers
for
the
businesses
before
signing
the
decree
directors
of
Baker
immediately
after
receiving
the
counter
proposal
filed
a
law
suit
in
Texas
in
a
Texas
state
court
to
force
to
Hughes
to
complete
the
merger
The
uncertainty
as
to
the
price
and
conditions
that
might
be
imposed
by
the
Department
of
Justice
makes
us
very
nervous
about
what
the
outcome
might
be
Kistler
said
explaining
why
Hughes
had
made
the
counter
proposal
We
need
additional
time
to
understand
why
Baker
did
not
accept
our
proposal
Kistler
also
said
that
the
law
suit
filed
by
Baker
not
a
factor
the
board
's
decision
to
keep
its
merger
proposal
on
the
table
declined
to
comment
on
the
allegations
in
the
lawsuit
said
Hughes
would
be
willing
to
consider
a
compromise
counter
proposal
declined
to
be
more
specific
Justice
Department
in
January
said
it
would
block
the
Hughes
and
Baker
merger
on
anti-trust
grounds
unless
both
companies
agreed
to
sign
a
consent
decree
that
would
provide
for
the
sale
of
the
assets
after
the
merger
took
place
Hughes
board
said
it
would
not
sign
the
decree
because
its
was
too
Hughes
said
that
Baker
should
instead
complete
the
sale
of
the
disputed
assets
before
the
merger
is
finalized
and
given
government
approval
the
decree
Baker
is
unable
to
find
acceptable
buyers
within
a
specified
period
of
time
after
the
decree
is
approved
federal
trustee
would
become
responsible
for
finding
a
buyer
said
that
under
those
terms

could
take
up

complete

said
meeting

numerical

was
less
important
than
a

slowing
the

was
evidence
deficits

Johnson
warned
against
reliance
on

to
finance

and
the
budget
deficit
and
keep
interest
rates
stable
This
situation
not
continue
indefinitely
or
later
progress
must
be
made
in
controlling
excessive
federal
spending
he
said
disinflationary
monetary
policy

continue
to
be
the
main
objective
of
the
Fed
said
also
said
a
more
stable

sustainable
alignment

was
needed
for

growth
the

deficit
warned
against
fix
he
identified
as
excessive

What
is
important
is
that
we
attempt

maintain
healthy
returns
to

and
adopt

said
and

are
clearly

now
Unless
we

down
He
did
not
elaborate
on
his
views
of
the
linkages
between
the
two

analysts
have
said
that
the
financing
of

requires
heavy
capital

there
's
still

way

go
Yeutter
said
said
the
problem
must
be
approached
on
many
fronts
and
focus
most
strongly
on

side
Yeutter
declined
to
comment
on
statements
relating

made
earlier
today
by
Commerce
Dept
undersecretary
of
Economic
Affairs
Robert
Ortner
a
Washington
address
to
an
Export-Import
Bank
sponsored
meeting
said
he
believed
the
dollar
at
current
levels
was
fairly
priced
against
most
European
currencies
that
the
yen
is
10
or
15
pct
undervalued
The
market
will
determine
the
dollar
's
proper
value
in
the
end
Yeutter
said
added
that
the
U.S.
and
other
nations
do
not
take
the
necessary
steps
to
cut
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
the
dollar
will
be
the
equalizer
Yeutter
said
there
is
no
quick
fix
to
the
trade
problem
and
any
resort
to
such
tactics
as
protectionist
trade
legislation
or
trade
restrictions
poses
real
dangers
said
's
relatively
little
that
Congress
can
do
to
legislate
a
solution
to
the
trade
problem
Protectionist
legislation
will
only
provoke
retaliation
by
U.S.
trading
partners
said
There
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
the
willingness
of
our
trading
partners
to
retaliate
against
unfair
trade
legislation
Yeutter
said
that
policy
flexibility
is
essential

sales
conditions

We

The

13
weeks

can
probably
be
explained
by
a
shift
of

from

vehicles
into
the
booming
stock
market
and
is
thus
not
an
indication
of
a
slowdown
in
the

expansion
the
data
raise
the
tantalizing
possibility
for
the
bond
markets
that
the
slowdown
in
money
growth
is
partly
a
reflection
of
a
weaker
economy
that
needs
more
Fed
stimulus
noted
that
the
slower
money
growth
coincides
with
signs
that
the

is
losing

the

an

in

from

Combined
with
the
increase
in

means
we
'll
get
a

in

he

that

that

for
by
striking

machinery
industries

so
economists
said
that
the

have
resulted
from

Benderly

noted
that
the

improved
in

at

while

so
American
banks
can
be
more
competitive
in
international
markets
It
has
become
abundantly
clear
that
our
financial
system
must
be
overhauled
to
bring
it
up
to
the
standard
that
will
be
required
if
we
are
to
remain
the
leading
financial
power
of
the
world
in
the
coming
years
Heller
said
in
a
speech
prepared
for
delivery
to
a
financial
services
industry
conference
said
a
patchwork
approach
to
changing
the
nation's
banking
and
financial
services
laws
will
not
work
Instead
comprehensive
overhaul
of
the
entire
financial
system
is
called
for
he
said
said
he
was
encouraged
that
Congress
would
take
a
comprehensive
look
at
reforming
the
nation
's
banking
laws
after
they
enact
legislation
now
pending
that
would
recapitalize
the
Federal
Savings
and
Loan
Insurance
Corp
and
give
federal
regulators
more
power
to
deal
with
failing
banks
said
he
liked
the
concept
of
the
financial
services
holding
company
would
allow
a
bank
to
exist
side
by
side
with
other
financial
services
companies
said
that
would
end
the
debate
on
securities
powers
for
banks
The
holding
company
may
own
both
a
securities
house
and
a
bank
that
both
services
may
be
provided
to
the
same
customer
to
safeguards
against
conflicts
of
interest
he
said
an
institution
be
in
a
better
position
to
compete
in
the
financial
services
markets
around
the
globe
said
said
he
expects
world
trade
to
expand
more
rapidly
that
domestic
production
and
that
traditional
trade
finance
should
grow
with
it
It
may
be
time
to
dust
off
the
old
letters
of
credit
and
to
prepare
for
an
increase
in
traditional
export
financing
opportunities
Heller
said
he
warned
that
protectionist
sentiments
could
the
golden
goose
that
is
about
to
provide
new
profit
opportunities
for
international
traders
and
bankers
alike
that
will
benefit
consumers
by
providing
them
with
cheaper
goods

supporters
of

said
even
that
scaled-down
version
would
not
be
equitable
for
farmers
the
English
bill
pertains
only
to
1987
winter
wheat
is
more
than
a
simple
disaster
payment
and

should
be
treated
equally

said
the
congressman
's
first
choice
is
to
make
the

available
to
all

farmers
the
political
reality
is
that
disaster
aid
for
winter
wheat
farmers
would
be
unavailable
because
of
controversy
over
spring
wheat
English
might
consider
an
even
greater
cutback
in
the

said
a

plan
could
forego

and
still
receive

does
not
want

fair
to

a
small
percentage
of

farmers
would
likely
sign

one

said
got
a
frosty
reception
in

instance
what
he
called
large-scale
solutions
such
as
debt
forgiveness
or
the
creation
of
new
multilateral

agencies
While
such
approaches
may
have
some
political
appeal
are
impractical
and
ultimately
counterproductive
Mulford
told

this

could
have
added
that
any

that
might
be
construed
as
a
bail-out
of

would
be
a
non-starter
in

bankers
said
the
Reagan

could
promote

and
regulatory
changes
to
foster

swaps

securitization

to
enable

options
The

should
be
encouraged
to
look
at
the
so-called

approach
he
said
said
the
aim
would
be
to
keep
the

syndicates
intact
or
allow
small
banks
to
write
off
their
exposure
in
a
way
that
is
not
detrimental

banks
say
it
is
unfair
that

continue
to
receive
interest
on

even
if
they
do
not

he

said
Bass
pushed

because
the

paid
too
much
oil

stronger
than
expected

were

to

mistaken
interpretation
of

act
the
Treasury
brief
said
Treasury
said
an
outright
U.S.
ban
of
uranium
ore
and
oxide
might
cause
foreign
electric
utilities
to
divert
their
South
African
origin
ore
and
oxide
to
other
countries
including
the
Soviet
Union
for
processing
said
it
would
allow
imports
of
the
South

ore
and
oxide
until
July
1
for
processing
and
re-export
that
the
imported
ore
or
oxide
is
accompanies
by
a
license
for
importation
issued
by
the
Nuclear
Regulatory

Townsend
Thoresen
navigating

Clive
Langley
said
the
RoRo
type
of

were
similar
in
some
respects
to
a

As
any

only
takes
two

three
inches
out

you
can
turn

over

you

more
stability
he

said
cross-Channel
ferries
were
normally
perfectly
stable
but
had
huge
wide
deck
areas
above
the
water
level
If
you
do
get
water
into
that
area
then
you
can
get
very
severe
effects
