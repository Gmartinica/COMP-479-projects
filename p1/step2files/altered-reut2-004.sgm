problems
to

's
domestic

he
told
a

in

But
these
short

difficulties

he

It

not

a

propensity

risk
from

Japan
has
so
massive
a

he

They
may

said

Washington
's

meant
a

local

argue
the

solution
to

problem
is
to
drop
foreign

controls

allow
the
local
dollar
to
find
its

level
Lifting
exchange
controls
is
the
final
answer
the
central
bank
is
not
prepared
to
do
it
simply
does
not
want
to
take
the
risk
said
one
local
banker
said
he
believed
the
new
restrictions
are
a
temporary
measure
designed
to
buy
time
as
the
central
bank
grapples
with
the
exchange
rate
problem
restrictions
are
a
bureaucratic
imposition

skirt
around
the
real
issue
said
needs
a
fundamental
restructuring
of

controls

The
controls
will
create
more
paperwork
the

charges
will
not
outweigh
the
profits

speculation

Financial

Committee
on
the
conclusions
so
far
of
an

committee
on
off-exchange

issues
said
We
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
meaningful
purpose
is
served
by
speculative
position
limits
Position
limits
were
supposed
to
prevent
market
manipulation
would
submit
that
the
Exchange
and
the
CFTC
currently
have
all
the
tools
necessary
to
prevent
market
manipulation
an
account
is
speculative
or
a
hedge
the
CBT
chairman
said
said
the
issue
was
of
particular
concern
to
the
CBT
because
the
exchange
faced
increasing
competition
from
foreign
markets
of
which
did
not
have
position
limits
said
the
ad
hoc
committee
he
also
chairs
agreed
to
propose
that
the
definition
of
hedging
be
expanded
to
include
risk
management
as
well
as
risk
reduction
said
there
was
a
danger
that
if
a
category
of
trading
was
given
a
name
such
as
hedging
insurance
companies
and
pension
funds
might
be
held
back
from
engaging
in
it
by
the
regulatory
bodies
that
govern
such
entities
ad
hoc
committee
proposed
the
establishment
of
guidelines
a
list
of
market
activities
that
fell
within
those
lines
which
might
be
lengthened
in
the
future
said
committee
might
also
propose
that
CBT
itself
be
allowed
to
enforce

limits

Minister
Brian
Mulroney
said
he
held
with
the
Canadian
province
premiers
on
the
pace
of
free
trade
talks
with
the
United
States
the
longstanding
issue
of
provincial
ratification
remains
to
be
settled
to
reporters
after
nearly
five
hours
of
meetings
with
the
10
premiers
said
further
discussions
would
be
held
in
June
and
September
to
discuss
the
role
of
the
provinces
in
approving
any
new
trade
deal
he
maintained
progress
was
being
made
in
the
sweeping
talks
with
the
Unites
States
that
got
under
nearly
two
years
ago
It
appears
reasonable
progress
is
being
made
the
talks
said
Premier
Don
Getty
agreed
Things
are
running
pretty
quickly
now
The
talks
by
Mulroney
's
Progressive
Conservative
government
after
concerns
about
protectionist
sentiment
in
the
U.S.
aimed
reducing
the
remaining
barriers
between
the
world
's
largest
trading
partnership
the
provinces
are
expected
to
play
a
major
role
in
any
new
trading
arrangement
some
of
the
provincial
leaders
complained
of
a
lack
of
progress
on
reaching
a
ratification
formula
It
's
my
view
that
we
should
be
thinking
about
these
things
right
now
with
the
questions
of
the
substance
of
the
agreement
commented
Ontario
Premier
David
Peterson
has
been
highly
critical
of
the
talks
in
the
past
Newfoundland
Premier
Brian
Peckford
said
an
agreement
was
more
likely
to
emerge
by
consensus
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
and
fast
formula
Peckford
said
it
appears
Canada
is
prepared
to
make
concessions
to
the
United
States
on
financial
services
in
order
to
make
inroads
on
other
bargaining
areas
as
agriculture
published
reports
government
sources
the
two
countries
are
close
to
reaching
a

deal
and
it
will
involve

many
non-tariff
barriers
over
the
next
10

rough
draft
of
the
accord
is

to

presented
to
the
premiers
at
the
June
meeting
while
the
finished
document
is
hoped
to
be

in

said
the

factor
in

The

be
how

one

said

there

Brazil
's
dominant
position
as
an
exporter
without
causing
a
price
war
opinion
among
exporters
was
that
Brazil
would
plan
to
export
between
17
and
18
mln

this
year
of
which
between
1.5
and
2.0
mln
would
be
to
non-members
of
the
ICO
15.5
mln
to
16
mln

sold
to

would
be
around
the
figure
Brazil
had
offered
to
ship
if

quotas
were
reintroduced
Dauster
has
said
this

expired
with
the
breakdown
of

prospects
of

28

7.0
mln
sources
added
sources
said
Brazil
is
unlikely
even
to
consider
exporting
such
quantities
this
would
almost
inevitably
lead
to
a
fall
in

prices
as
Brazil
tried

Maude
said
I
wouldn't
be
surprised
to
see
a
fall-off
in

since

probably
wo
n't
be

of

not
be

bill
--
only
an

of

premature

we
can
at

move
in

direction
Boschwitz
said
Johnson
president
of

in

of
decoupling
would

and
the

Association
said
their
groups
oppose
any
0/92
or
decoupling
plan
due
to
concerns
about
reopening
the

and
creating
more
confusion
among
farmers
when
asked
if
his

were

to
choose
between
a
ten
pct
cut
in

prices
or
a

Unless

Volcker
warned
said
one
problem
is
that
economic
activity

two
years

supported
largely
by

said
that
rising
consumption
was
achieved
at

expense

personal
savings
the

time
said
huge
Federal
budget
deficit
is
absorbing
a
disproportionate
amount
of
the

generated

Volcker
said
the
adverse
consequences
of
the
combination
of
low
savings
rates
and
high
Federal
budget
deficits
have
been
escaped
by
drawing
on
capital
from
abroad
noted
that

capital
into

in

exceeded

said
one
potential

would
be
an

remain
skeptical
of

for

Should
the

be

the

In

Stephen

Economists
generally

in

after

stress
that

will
not

enough
to
prevent

from

if
the

on

and
so
continue
to
present
no

for
the

said
the
Fed
appears
to
be
very
comfortable
with
its
current

stance
and
it
is
likely
to
wait
for
perhaps
several
more

before
deciding
whether

not
to

the

's

analysts
agreed
that
there
is
almost
no

that
the

will
choose
to
raise

said

In
the

decided
not

to
lower
the

also
to
adopt

that

this
means
the

that
Colombia

not

suffer
from

said
ruled
out
a
much
higher
volume
of
exports
up
to
13.5

as
mentioned
in

because
the

U.S.
Economic
officials

targets
Sprinkel
of
the
Council
of
Economic
Advisers
the
Reagan
Administration
's
opposition
to
a
tax
increase
and
its
pledge
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
cutting
spending
and
fostering
economic
growth
contrast
Penner
of
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
the
budget
process
has
broken
down
and
the
deficit
will
remain
close
to
200
billion
dlrs
for
fiscal
1987
told
a
symposium
sponsored
by
New
York
University
that
spending
could
be
cut
by
avoiding
decisions
based
on
the
desire
to
influence
votes
and
by
shifting
the
responsibility
for
local
projects
to
state
governments
also
suggested
a
line-item
veto
allows
the
President
to
veto
parts
of
bill
without
rejecting
all
of
it
limit
wasteful
spending
and
taxing
decisions
should
be
linked
more
closely
said
the
Administration
still
looks
for
2.7
pct
growth
in
U.S.
Real
gross
national
product
1987
and
3.5
pct
in
1988
if
the
latest
economic
reports
signal
this
rate
of
economic
growth
is
attainable
said
It
looks
pretty
good
to
me
've
had
two
very
strong
employment
reports
He
also
said
federal
reserve
policy
is
appropriate
It
looks
like
they
're
on
track
While
further
reductions
are
needed
in
the
trade
deficit
said
the
lower
dollar
is
having
an
impact
new
1987
tax
laws
will
not
hurt
the
economy
and
the
tax
reform
act
of
1986
significantly
lowers
tax
rates
and
will
greatly
increase
private
production
incentives
said
Our
estimates
at
the
Council
of
Economic
Advisers
suggest
national
net
output
of
goods
and
services
will
permanently
increase
by
approximately
two
pct
because
of
the
long-run
consequences
of
tax
reform
Sprinkel
said
In
1986
would
have
amounted
to
an
increase
of
approximately
600
dlrs
in
the
income
of
the
average
American
family
Sprinkel
also
argued
the
1981
tax
cuts
were
not
responsible
for
the
large
increase
in
the
budget
deficit
fiscal
1986
ending
September
spending
amounted
to
23.8
pct
of
GNP
federal
receipts
absorbed
18.5
pct
of
GNP
a
deficit
of
5.3
pct
said
said
that
with
fiscal
1978
1986
federal
expenditure
share
of
GNP
is
2.7
percentage
points
higher
and
the
revenue
share
of
GNP
is
virtually
the
same
Contrary
to
the
conventional
wisdom
1981
tax
cut
is
not
the
root
cause
of
the
extraordinary
budget
deficits
of
the
past
few
years
Sprinkel
said
This
tax
cut
merely
rolled
back
the
inflation-induced
tax
increases
that
occurred
between
1978
and
1981
he
added
Congressional
Budget
Office
's
Rudolph
Penner
argued
that
the
tax
cut
in
1981
was
misguided
Since
making
the
big
mistake
in
1981
of
cutting
taxes
enormously
without
any
plan
to
decrease
spending
by
the
Administration
or
Congress
with
increases
in
defence
spending
all
the
options
reducing
the
budget
deficit
unpleasant
he
said
said
the
tax
cut
resulted
from
the
ideological
turmoil
in
the
U.S
by
the
sustained
inflation
in
our
nation
's
history
which
helped
foster
widespread
distrust
of
government
The
American
people
turned
on
the
government
with
tax
revolt
at
the
state
level
and
new
demands
on
the
government
at
the
national
level
Penner
said
But
their
dislike
of
taxes
exceeded
their
general
dislike
of
spending
programs
the
correction
of
that
1981
mistake
demands
that
the
system
change
a
lot
Penner
sees
little
hope
the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
budget
deficit
reduction
targets
will
be
met
and
said
the
deficit
will
remain
at
roughly
200
billion
dlrs
this
year
said
a
budget
process
that
sets
targets
arbitrarily
is
not
likely
to
succeed
I
feel
pretty
safe
in
saying
that
any
process
that
tries
to
dictate
a
numerical
outcome
from
above
is
doomed
to
fail
simply
because
there
's
no
to
enforce
it
Penner
said
questioned
the
methods
by
which
the
1987
budget
deficit
was
cut
said
18
to
19
billion
dlrs
were
eliminated
by
one-time
measures
as
a
temporary
increase
in
taxes
related
to
tax
reform
and
sales
of
government
assets
Another
four
billion
dlrs
was
cut
by
what
I
call

timing

moving
the
military
payday
from
the
last
day

1987

Most

analysts
now
expect

said

very

whether

's
budget
The
Conservative

is
eager
to
get
the
basic
rate
of
tax
down
to
25
pct
as
soon
as
possible
every
pound
off
the
tax
base
would
make
the
opposition
Labour
Party's
spending
plans
look
more
painful
to
the
electorate

direct
revenue
effect
of
a
one
penny
change
in
the
basic
rate
of

tax
would
be
about
1.1

the

's
distinct

optimism

tax
measures
which
Lawson

expected
to
announce
will
be
based
firmly
on
a
positive
assessment
of
past
economic
achievements
and
confidence
for
the
future
add
even
if
he
does
cut
his
planned
PSBR

1987/88

between
one
and

most
economists
predict
is
still
likely
to
find
himself
announcing
a
higher
PSBR
than
the
outturn
for
this
financial
year.^M
That
could
leave
him
with
a
presentation
problem
say
lower
PSBR
would
raise
financial
confidence
by
reassuring
markets
that
the
borrowing
burden
imposed
by
the

would
stay
low

certain
key
aspects

over-optimistic

main
electoral
attraction
of

to

's
opposition
to

increase
and
its
pledge
to
reduce

by
cutting
spending
and
fostering
economic
growth
contrast
Penner
of
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
the
budget
process
has
broken
down
and
the
deficit
will
remain
close
to
200
billion
dlrs
for
fiscal
1987
told
a
symposium
sponsored
by
New
York
University
that
spending
could
be
cut
by
avoiding
decisions
based
on
the
desire
to
influence
votes
and
by
shifting
the
responsibility
for
local
projects
to
state
governments
also
suggested
a
line-item

allows

veto
parts
of

wasteful

in

Real
gross

product

and
3.5
pct
in

if
the
latest
economic
reports
signal
this
rate
of
economic
growth
is
attainable
said
It
looks
pretty
good
to
me
've
had
two
very
strong
employment
reports
He
also
said
federal
reserve
policy
is
appropriate
It
looks
like
they
're
on
track
While
further
reductions
are
needed
in
the
trade
deficit
said
the
lower
dollar
is
having
an
impact
new
1987
tax
laws
will
not
hurt
the
economy
and
the
tax
reform
act
of
1986
significantly
lowers
tax
rates
and
will
greatly
increase
private
production
incentives
said
Our
estimates
at
the
Council
of
Economic
Advisers
suggest
national
net
output
of
goods
and
services
will
permanently
increase
by
approximately
two
pct
because
of
the
long-run
consequences
of
tax
reform
Sprinkel
said
In
1986
would
have
amounted
to
an
increase
of
approximately
600
dlrs
in
the
income
of
the
average
American
family
Sprinkel
also
argued
the
1981
tax
cuts
were
not
responsible
for
the
large
increase
in
the
budget
deficit
fiscal
1986
ending
September
spending
amounted
to
23.8
pct
of
GNP
federal
receipts
absorbed
18.5
pct
of
GNP
a
deficit
of
5.3
pct
said
said
that
with
fiscal
1978
1986
federal
expenditure
share
of
GNP
is
2.7
percentage
points
higher
and
the
revenue
share
of
GNP
is
virtually
the
same
Contrary
to
the
conventional
wisdom
1981
tax
cut
is
not
the
root
cause
of
the
extraordinary
budget
deficits
of
the
past
few
years
Sprinkel
said
This
tax
cut
merely
rolled
back
the
inflation-induced
tax
increases
that
occurred
between
1978
and
1981
he
added
Congressional
Budget
Office
's
Rudolph
Penner
argued
that
the
tax
cut
in
1981
was
misguided
Since
making
the
big
mistake
in
1981
of
cutting
taxes
enormously
without
any
plan
to
decrease
spending
by
the
Administration
or
Congress
with
increases
in
defence
spending
all
the
options
reducing
the
budget
deficit
unpleasant
he
said
said
the
tax
cut
resulted
from
the
ideological
turmoil
in
the
U.S
by
the
sustained
inflation
in
our
nation
's
history
which
helped
foster
widespread
distrust
of
government
The
American
people
turned
on
the
government
with
tax
revolt
at
the
state
level
and
new
demands
on
the
government
at
the
national
level
Penner
said
But
their
dislike
of
taxes
exceeded
their
general
dislike
of
spending
programs
the
correction
of
that
1981
mistake
demands
that
the
system
change
a
lot
Penner
sees
little
hope
the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
budget
deficit
reduction
targets
will
be
met
and
said
the
deficit
will
remain
at
roughly
200
billion
dlrs
this
year
said
a
budget
process
that
sets
targets
arbitrarily
is
not
likely
to
succeed
I
feel
pretty
safe
in
saying
that
any
process
that
tries
to
dictate
a
numerical
outcome
from
above
is
doomed
to
fail
simply
because
there
's
no
to
enforce
it
Penner
said
questioned
the
methods
by
which
the
1987
budget
deficit
was
cut
said
18
to
19
billion
dlrs
were
eliminated
by
one-time
measures
as
a
temporary
increase
in
taxes
related
to
tax
reform
and
sales
of
government
assets
Another
four
billion
dlrs
was
cut
by
what
I
call
creative
timing
changes
moving
the
military
payday
from
the
last
day
of

1987
to
the

Valery

this

due

two

members
have
jealously
guarded
their

The
basic
problem
of

is
that

are
not
prepared
to
make
the
quantum
leap
to
a
situation
where
certain
decisions
are
taken
in

said
one
economist
who
has
closely
watched
the

is
that
the
EC
is
often
divided
over

what
the

say
is
the

greatest

of

Bank
that
if
Latin
countries
were
unable
to
speed
up
their
economic
growth
in
the
long
run
there
would
be
a
default
told
a

foreshadowing
the

's

next

For
the

it
is
convenient
to
be
repaid
to
achieve
that
countries
need
to
grow
they
do
n't
in
the
long
run
there
will
be
a
default
Ortiz
Mena
warned
that
Latin
America
needed
to
reverse
the
capital
outflows
from
the
region
and
beyond
that
needed
more
resources
Mena
declined
to
agree
with
estimates
that
capital
outflows
from
Latin
America
last
year
totaled
35
billion
dlrs
and
that
therefore
he
was
calling
for
an
inflow
into
the
region
above
that
sum
said
the
U.S.
debt
strategy
envisaged
stepped
up
lending
by
commercial
and
multilateral
banks
to
major
debtor
nations
of
29
billion
dlrs
over
three
years
insufficient
to
achieve
the
necessary
rates
of
growth
he
did
stress
the
U.S.
plan
was
important
and
the
right
approach
Mena
said
It
is
in
the
interest
of
the
creditors
only
the
debtors
push
forward
the
development
process
in
Latin
America
and
that
has
happened
He
added
The
only
problem
is
the
resources
have
not
been
enough
Turning
to
Brazil
growth
rate
he
predicted
will
decline
slightly
this
year
from
1986
Mena
said
the
country
's
moratorium
was
the
right
action
in
order
to
avert
a
long
term
default
So
it
's
preferable
they
negotiate
now
a
move
which
would
eliminate
any
chance
of
panic
in
the
markets
Mena
also
said
that
Brazilian
authorities
have
opened
negotiations
already
with

pointed

Brazil
took
the
action
because

but
then
when

came
to

all
the

What
it

was
distort

write-offs
