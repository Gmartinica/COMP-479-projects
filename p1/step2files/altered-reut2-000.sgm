'm
particularly
impressed
by

because
it

thought
The

pointed
out
that
a

for

was
led
by
declines
in

said
the
drop
in

may
have

a
response
to

speculated
a

would
make
most
sense
to
one
variation
on

rumors
of
a
total
spinoff
analysts
that
any
spinoff
of
Shearson
would
be
good
since
it
is
a
strong

center
for
American

about
20
pct

Eckenfelder

said
he
believes
American
Express
could
have
considered
a
partial
spinoff
in
the
past

he
said

if
American

reduced
its

OPEC
may
be
forced
to
meet
before
a
scheduled
June
session
to
readdress
its
production
cutting
agreement
if
the
organization
wants
to
halt
the
current
slide
in
oil
prices
industry
analysts
said
The
movement
to
higher
oil
prices
was
never
to
be
as
easy
as
OPEC
thought
may
need
an
emergency
meeting
to
sort
out
the
problems
said
Daniel
Yergin
of
Cambridge
Energy
Research
Associates
and
oil
industry
sources
said
the
problem
OPEC
faces
is
excess
oil
supply
in
world
oil
markets
OPEC
's
problem
is
not
a
price
problem
but
a
production
issue
and
must
be
addressed
in
that
way
said
Paul
Mlotok
analyst
with
Salomon
Brothers
Inc
said
the
market
's
earlier
optimism
about
OPEC
and
its
ability
to
keep
production
under
control
have
given
way
to
a
pessimistic
outlook
that
the
organization
must
address
soon
if
it
wishes
to
regain
the
initiative
in
oil
prices
some
other
analysts
were
uncertain
that
even
an
emergency
meeting
would
address
the
problem
of
OPEC
production
above
the
15.8
mln
bpd
quota
set
last
December
OPEC
has
to
learn
that
in
a
buyers
market
you
can
not
have
deemed
quotas
prices
and
set
differentials
said
the
regional
manager
for
one
of
the
major
oil
companies
who
spoke
on
condition
that
he
not
be
named
The
market
is
now
trying
to
teach
them
that
lesson
again
he
added
T.
Mizrahi
of
Mideast
reports
OPEC
to
meet
before
June
not
immediately
is
not
optimistic
that
OPEC
can
address
its
principal
problems
They
will
not
meet
now
as
they
try
to
take
advantage
of
the
winter
demand
to
sell
their
oil
in
late
March
and
April
when
demand
slackens
Mizrahi
said
Mizrahi
said
that
OPEC
is
unlikely
to
do
anything
more
than
reiterate
its
agreement
to
keep
output
at
15.8
mln
bpd
Analysts
said
that
the
next
two
months
will
be
critical
for
OPEC
's
ability
to
hold
together
prices
and
output
OPEC
must
hold
to
its
pact
for
the
next
six
to
eight
weeks
since
buyers
will
come
back
into
the
market

the

said
both

in

the
need

Billington

several

proposals
range
from
consolidation
of

into

de-centralizing

percentage
points
to

gdp
growth
of

while

would
account
for
1.75

said
the
overall
impact
of
the
changed
economic
parameters
is
welcome
as
it
appears
to
have
contributed
to
a
slightly
more
rapid
correction
in
the
current
account
deficit
than
first
anticipated
The
government
initially
forecast
a
current
account
deficit
for
1986/87
of
14.75
billion
--
our
present
expectation
is
that
the
result
will
be
somewhat
lower
14
billion
he
said
indicators
released
since
the
last
meeting
of
EPAC
in
December
indicate
that
the
1986/87
budget
strategy
is
broadly
on
track
said
They
indicate
that
domestic
demand
has
been
a
little
more
sluggish
than
was
expected
at
budget
time
he
said
On
the
other
hand
exports
seem
to
be
expanding
by
more
than
expected
at
budget
time
this
is
underpinning
growth
in
domestic
production
and
employment
Keating
said
it
now
seems
likely
that
the
1986/87
inflation
rate
will
exceed
the
budget
forecast
of
eight
pct
Nevertheless
is
likely
to
be
a
marked
slowing
in
inflation
over
coming
quarters
as
depreciation
and
budgetary
effects
wane
he
said
said
the
government
expects
economic
growth
to
pick
up
moderately
in
1987/88
due
to
a
further
significant
rise
in
net
exports
and
a
very
moderate
but
positive
contribution
from
private
domestic
demand
said
domestic
demand
growth
will
be
due
to
a
strengthening
in
real
household
disposable
income
moderate
rise
in
economic
growth
next
financial
year
should
be
sufficient
to
sustain

growth
at
a

broadly
equivalent
to
that
of
the
current
fiscal
year
The
current

deficit
will
continue
to
show

in

Keating
said
As
the
impact
of
the

of
its

in

Community
steelmakers
presented
the
Executive
Commission
with
a
controversial
plan
for
the
future
of
the
industry
which
diplomats
say
it
may
be
forced
reluctantly
to
accept
the
plan
steel
output
would
remain
subject
to
restrictive
quotas
and
imports
would
be
firmly
controlled
for
years
to
come
while
steel
firms
undertook
a
massive
slimming-down
operation
to
adjust
capacity
to
lower
demand
Commissioner
Karl-Heinz
Narjes
has
proposed
the
ending
of
the
quota
system
by
December
1988
has
proposed
a
return
to
the
free
market
under
EC
law
is
supposed
to
exist
except
in
times
of
crisis
But
diplomats
said
some
ministers
who
meet
to
discuss
this
idea
on
March
19
will
argue
that
steel
firms
are
in
crisis
in
their
countries
orders
falling
as
customers
switch
to
alternative
products
and
accounts
firmly
in
the
red
from
the
EC
's
major
steel
producing
countries
are
likely
to
shy
away
from
Narjes
'
proposals
and
could
back
the
industry
's
own
plan
instead
the
hope
of
minimising
the
political
impact
of
plant
closures

the
plan
presented
to

by
the
EC
steelmakers
'
lobby
group
Eurofer
would
retain
the
quota
production
system
at

added
the

the
support
of

Commission
and

in
carrying
out
a
closure
program
with
social
costs

calls

legal
practice
where

execute

as
well
as

this

dual

It
's
a
question
of
the
integrity
of
the
person
you
do

with
Wolff
said
traders
who
act
as
brokers
that
trading
for

necessary
in

errors
they
inevitably
make
when
filling
customer
orders
in

To
have
an
absolute

Finance
Minister
Dilson
Funaro
flatly
rejected
a
U.K
that
his
country
seek
International
Monetary
Fund
help
in
order
to
facilitate
debt
negotiations
with
commercial
creditor
banks
to
reporters
said
this
attitude
would
not
help
resolve
the
crisis
started
when
Brazil
suspended
indefenitely
interest
payments
on
68
billion
dlrs
in
external
debt
on
February
20
was
in
Britain
on
the
first
leg
of
a
tour
of
European
capitals
to
explain
the
motives
of
the
Brazilian
debt
moratorium
and
to
seek
support
for
intiatives
to
improve
capital
flows
between
developed
countries
and
third
world
debtor
nations
before
his
departure
for
Paris
said
there
could
be
no
question
of
Brazil
adopting
another
IMF
austerity
plan
after
a
similar
package
four
years
ago
Brazil
in
a
very
big
recession
had
an
IMF
program
simply
meant
export
more
and
import
less
are
not
going
to
go
the
IMF
he
said
was
reactnng
to
a
British
statement
following
his
talks
with
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
the
U.K.
Government
had
no
part
to
play
in
what
it
viewed
as
a
problem
between
Brazil
and
its
commercial
creditor
banks
also
believed
an
IMF
program
would
help
along
negotiations
between
Brazil
and
the
commercial
banks
statement
banking
sources
interpreted
as
an
outright
rebuttal
of
all
Brazilian
demands
That
was
not
my
impression
of
the
meeting
Funaro
said
But
if
the
is
more
or
less
like
this
that
means
nothing
is
helping
to
find
a
solution
Funaro
stressed
that
his
talks
in
Washington
last
week
and
in
Europe
this
week
were
aimed
at
gaining
official
support
to
unblock
lending
from
official
credit
agencies
than
to
deal
with
Brazils
ties
with
commercial
banks
Since
1982
official
agencies
have
been
closed
to
my
country
he
said
said
Lawson
had
made
no
commitments
to
support
Brazil's
efforts
would
officially
state
his
position
when
the
two
meet
again
next
month
for
the
IMF
and
World
Bank
spring
meetings
in
Washington
said
there
was
no
binding
time
schedule
for
Brazil's
debt
problem
to
be
resolved
said
Brazil
had
not
come
to
Europe
with
specific
proposals
to
overcome
the
present
crisis
We
did
n't
come
here
to
make
a
cash-flow
programme
he
said
We
will
have
meetings
at
the
IMF
next
month
's
see
what
happens
Neither
did
Brazil
plan
a
major
overhaul
of
current
domestic
economic
policies
Funaro
said
would
likely
lead
to
a
five
pct
economic
growth
this
year
Over
the
past
five
years
we
paid
back
45

's

following

to
vigorously
protect

Yeutter
said
said
the
proposed
vegetable
oils
tax
would
violate
EC
obligations
under
the
GATT
said
the
effect
of
the
tax
would
be
to
double

produced
from

margarine
made
from

more
expensive
than

dispute

the

would
allow

The

will

in

the

MITI
spokesman
said
If
the

of

is
increasing
for

suggests
they

roasters
said
The
fall
is
a
technical
and
emotional
reaction
to
the
failure
to
agree
on
reintroduction
of
ICO
export
quotas
it
will
not
be
long
before

itself
and

a
spokesman
for
one
of
the

Dutch

said
The
fact
is
that
while
there
are
ample
supplies
of
coffee
available
at
present
is
a
shortage
of
quality
he
said
Average
prices
fell
to
around
110
cents
a

following
the
news
of
the

we
expect
them
to

Association
secretary
Jan
de

said
although
the
roasters
were
disappointed
at
the
failure
of
consumer
and
producer
ICO
representatives
to
agree
on
quota
reintroduction
was
equally
important
that
quotas
be
reallocated
on
a
more
equitable
basis
There
is
no
absolute
need
for
quotas
at
this
moment
because
the
market
is
well
balanced
and
we
must
not
lose
this
opportunity
to
renegotiate
the
coffee
agreement
he
said
There
is
still
a
lot
of
work
to
be
