the

on

came
after

Had
signalled
it

to
attend
a

the

of

Germany
made
such
a
move
in

authorities
could
have
been
persuaded
cuts
in

early
as
last

as
saying
No

The

meeting
of
the
Group
of
Six
industrial
nations
took
place
exactly
one
month
after
the
German
cut
in

emphasised
in
his
comments
the
very
close
talks
between
central

before
and
after
the
G-6
meeting
that
financial
markets
had
not
fully
realised
the
significance
of
the
Paris
session
and
the
U.S.
Agreement
to
stem
further
falls
in
the
value
of
the

sources
said
the
first
time
all
participants
at
the

agreed
that
a
further
fall
in
the
dollar
would
be
harmful
for
all
world
economies
the
U.S.
had
said
sources
said
the
tone
of
Poehl
's
comments
boosted

sentiment
that
the

would
be
stabilised
around
current
levels
by
international
central
bank
cooperation
source
said
Poehl
's
remarks
also
underlined
the
fact
that
the
Bundesbank
was
now
more
prepared
to
be
accommodative
in
monetary
policy
in
order
to
prevent
a
further
slowdown
in
West
Germany
's
economic
growth
and
other
Bundesbank
officials
have
in
the
past
stressed
that
the
German
central
bank
had
no
direct
responsibility
for
growth
and
was
solely
concerned
with
combatting
inflation

introduction
of
a
tighter
monetary
stance
from
the
beginning
of
December
until
the
half-point
cut

January
sources
quoted
Poehl
as
saying
that
the
current
overshooting
of
the
German
monetary
target
would
not
directly
respark

was
not
obliged
to
react
immediately

the

the

remarks
prepared
for

before
the
Economic
Club

There
should
be
total
resolve
that
the

versus
other
major
currencies
well
as
the
currencies
of
other
nations
having
a
substantial
trade
surplus
with
us
continue
to
decline
so
that
the
correction
in
our
trade
deficit
starts
on
the
road
to
recovery
Roderick
said
the
U.S.
should
be
understanding
of
the
pain
trading
partners
experience
as
a
result
of
a
falling
dollar
added
As
painful
as
the
correction
may
be
to
our

partners
is
less
painful
than
leaving
the

uncorrected
because
that
would
lead

inevitable

steep

said
between

1985

December

the

company
spokesman
said

data
were
provided

the
70

factors
were
involved
said
it
is

today
said
there
is
no
unanimity
within

on
how

but
there
is
consensus
on
removing
several
government
policies
that
hinder
investments
in

windfall
profit
tax
should
be
abolished
immediately

current

he

ensure
the

allowed

adversity
Commission
said
the
poor
economic
outlook
noted
in
its
last
decision

persisted
was
perhaps
now
more
serious
The
prevailing
uncertainty
and
lack

the
government
's
share
rose
to
21.32
billion
from
20.75
billion
said
in
a
statement
this
was
due
to
the
boosting
of
reserves
to
refinance
so-called
Big
These
reserves
do
not
add
to
New

's
total
indebtedness
....
They
are
money
in
the
bank
he
said
As
negotiations
to
refinance
each
Think
Big
project
are
completed
loans
will
be
replaced
with
debt
currently
held
in
reserves
for
this
purpose
Douglas
added
in
turn
will
result
in
a
drop
in
quasi-government
and
private
debt
said
said
refinancing
of
projects
allowed
the
government
to
borrow
on
more
favourable
terms
and
to
manage
Think
Big
debts
more
effectively
Both
of
these
will
reduce
the
cost
of
Think
Big
to
the
taxpayer
over
time
he
said
The
refinancing
also
paves
the
way
to
deregulation

One
scenario
then

be
to

Another
scenario
is
the

third
scenario
is

International
Monetary

has
warned
Israel
in
a
report
that
a
continued

could
undo
the
achievements
of

stabilization
program
in
controlling
hyperinflation
IMF
delegation
visited
Israel
this
week
an
interim
report
praising
Israel
's
success
in
slashing
inflation
from
440
pct
in
1985
to
19.7
pct
last
year
without
triggering
mass
unemployment
it
held
up
Argentina
and
Brazil
as
examples
of
the
perils
awaiting
countries
who
did
not
follow
up
on
stabilization
programs
Continued
rapid
rise
in
wages
would
threaten
the
progress
in
reducing
inflation
and
the
present
level
of
employment
the
IMF
said
report
echoed
warnings
last
week
by
Bank
of
Israel
Governor
Michael
Bruno
and
the
private
Bank
Hapoalim
that
higher
wages
overspending
and
a
consumer
boom
were
rekindling
inflation
Though
wage
developments
and
the
reacceleration
of
inflation
are
worrisome
is
still
time
to
put
the
stabilization
program
back
on
track

warning
comes
ahead
of
Israel

public

negotiations

Hapoalim
chief

Petahia

real
growth
of

about
10
pct

fall
of
between
15
and
20
pct
in
the
second
half
of
1985
when
the
government
's
economic
stabilisation
programme
was
introduced
forecast
last
week
that
inflation
would
rise
to
around
30
pct
this
year

a
second
devaluation
might
be
necessary

here
due
consultation

my
colleagues
in

hereby
wish
to
emphasize
that
Nigeria
and
all
member
countries
of
OPEC
remain
determined
to
uphold
the
December
agreement
by
adhering
strictly
to
their
various
quotas
and
official
selling
prices
Lukman
added
no
extraordinary
OPEC
conference
was
planned
We
are
in
a
position
to
re-confirm
that
misleading
news
in

to
the
contrary
OPEC
member
countries
as
a
whole
produced
below
their
agreed
quota
in
the
month
of
February
Lukman
is
Nigerian
oil
minister
put
the
overall
OPEC
output
shortfall
in
February
at
900,000
bpd
and
said
this
was
as
a
result
of
their
firm
determination
to
defend
official
selling
prices
of
18
dlrs
agreed
upon
last
December
in
Geneva
December
agreement
set
an
overall
output
ceiling
for
OPEC
of
15.8
mln
bpd
for
first
half
1987
and
restored
fixed
prices
as
from
February
1
around
a
reference
point
of
18
dlrs
prices
rallied
immediately
after
the
Geneva
accord
but
fell
again
last
month
on
reports
that
OPEC
was
producing
more
than
the
agreed
level
The
idea
was
to
suggest
that
OPEC
's
agreement
would
not
hold
and
this
caused
some
customers
to
hold
back
purchases
of
OPEC
oil
and
resort
to
destocking
to
meet
their
needs
Lukman
said
said
the
900,000
bpd
shortfall
last
February
was
based
on
the
verified
figure
for
10
out
of
OPEC
's
13
members
that
Nigeria
alone
had
a
shortfall
in
production
of
100,000
bpd
disassociated
itself
from
the
December
agreement
the
production
figures
of
Ecuador
and
the
United
Arab
Emirates
needed
to
be
verified
said
If
that
is
the
price
we
have
to
pay
to
make
the
agreement
succeed
are
ready
is
not
changing
its
price
level
of
18
dlrs
the
group
's
president
said
said
the

price
differentials
committee
meeting
formerly
postponed
to
April
had
been
put
off
indefinitely
Furthermore
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
conference
is
at
the
moment
contemplated
since
most
agreements
reached
in
December
are
being
adhered
to
he
said
if
the
committee
did
not
need
to
meet
soon
to
narrow
the
gaps
in
the
prices
of
the
various
OPEC
crudes
--
fixed
in
relation
to
the
18
dlr
benchmark
--
Lukman
replied
consider
the
defence
of
our
prices
much
more
crucial
than
differentials
Lukman
said
OPEC
was
aware
that
consumers
had
heavily
drawn
on
stocks
of
both
crude
oil
and
refined
products
to
levels
well
below
this
time
last
year
and
soon
they
would
return
to
the
market
in
search
of
crude
We
do
n't
see
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
difficulty
in
maintaining
the
18
dlr
price
throughout
the
rest
of
the

dismissed
the
possibility

any

of

on
the
grounds
the

were
demanding
nothing

retraction
of

If

Nakasone
would
close

on

27
as
scheduled
the
Venice
summit
of

in

and
open
an

discuss
the

plans
the
aide
said
law
regular

can
be
extended
only
once
while
an
extraordinary
session
can
be
extended
twice.The
other
option
would
be
to

said
The

will
surely
present
a

motion
against
the
Nakasone
Cabinet
at
one
stage
or
another
One
scenario
then
will
be
to
reject

opening
up
the
way
for

reform
Another
scenario
is
the
resignation
of

third
scenario
is
a
dissolution
of
the
Lower

for

said

of

at

It

Stockbrokers
James
Capel
said
in
a
comment
the
move
by
the
National
Savings
Department
was
considerable
significance
It
said
the
real
message
that
the
decks
are
being
quickly
cleared
so
as
to
facilitate
a
speedy
decision
by
the
building
societies
to
cut
their
rates
when
the
inevitable
cut
in
bank
base
rates
to
10
pct
materialises
Building
societies
have
said
a
drop
in
bank
base
rates
would
normally
have
to
exceed
half
a
point
to
give
rise
to
a
reduction
in
mortgage
lending
rates
of
Phillips
and
Drew
said
he
too

may
reflect

policy
to
point

a

rate
cut

he
said

other

said

Nigel
Lawson
was
keen
to
see

fall
to
keep
a

Inflation
upward
pressure
on

is
stronger

this
year
and
above
five

's
3.7
pct
the
impact
of
mortgage
rates
on
consumer
prices
said
a
one-point
cut
in
building
society
rates
would
reduce
inflation
in
Britain
by
about
0.4
pct
Lewis
and
others
noted
that
building
societies
had
been
complaining
to
the
government
about
intense
competition
from
National
Savings
they
argued
reduced
the
scope
for
early
mortgage
rate
cuts

noted
that

's
sale
occurred
against

backdrop
of
a
slightly
weak
secondary

said
they
believed
that
Chrysler
was
sold
the
corporates
at
a
large
profit
because
the

were
bought
by
the

It

Metzenbaum
Ohio
Democrat

violation

meet

it
might
refuse
to

Assistant
Attorney
General
for
Antitrust
Charles
Rule
defended
the
administration
's
record
on
antitrust
enforcement
and
told
the
panel
at
today
's
hearing
that
the
department
was
in
the
process
of
preparing
a
response
to
Metzenbaum
's
request
We
have
nothing
to
hide
we
have
to
be
concerned
about
our
institutional
interests
Rule
said
provided
no
explanation
of
what
those
interests
were
said
he
had
scheduled
the

and
requested
the
data
out
of
concern
this
administration
has
abandoned
the
nation
's
historical
commitment
to
effective
antitrust
enforcement
green
light
is
on
he
said
Merger
mania
is
rampant
in
this
country
it
is
not
serving
us
well
Rule
countered
that
the
low
inflation
and
interest
rates
and
the
continuing
economic
expansion
meant
the
administration
's
policies
were
working
well
said
simply
looking
at
the
number
of
challenges
filed
against
pending
mergers
was
misleading
because
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
fixed
proportion
of
all
mergers
were
anticompetitive
If
you
look
at
the
individual
cases
rather
than
the
statistics
will
see
that
we
are
appropriately
enforcing
the
antitrust
laws

sharply
cutting

Brazil
by

said
With
its
decision
U.S.
government
recognised
the
honesty
of
Brazilian
exporters
never
have
the
intention
of
practising
dumping
In

yesterday
U.S.
government
eliminated
the
duties
shipped
by
Sucocitrico
Cutrale
and
cut
to
1.96

the
duty
on
Citrosuco
of
8.54

said
Brazil
had
enough
orange
juice
to
meet
the
needs
of
its
major
clients
We
do
not

what
we
would
like
to
have
we
certainly
have
enough
orange
juice
available
to
supply
our
buyers
Peres
said

To
keep
it
a

is

the

policy
of
the

was
based

'
secret

the

was
still
debating
the

and
had
come
to
no

of
the

to
be
pursued
the
lawmakers
said
the
House
Democratic

has
asked
the

to
come
up
with
a

of
36

in
deficit-reducing
measures
package
would
include
18

dlrs
in

billion
dlrs
in

cuts
and
nine

said
they
were
still
trying

meet
those

but
had
made
no

said
they
were
having

coming
up

Department
of
Transportation
it
would
go
ahead
at
seven
airports
with
a
controversial
plan
to
reduce
airline
delays
by
enabling
competing
companies
to
coordinate
their
schedules
the
plan
DOT
will
grant
the
airlines
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws
so
they
can
redistribute
their
flight
times
over
the
day
and
avoid
the
clustering
of
flights
that
typically
occurs
at
the
most
desirable
travel
times
Secretary
Elizabeth
Dole
said
she
had
decided
to
grant
unconditional
immunity
to
the
carriers
serving
Atlanta
's
Hartsfield
and
Chicago
's
O'Hare
airports
five
other
airports
--
Dallas-Fort
Worth
and
Philadelphia
--
Dole
said
she
would
grant
conditional
immunity
to
enable
further
government
study
this
part
of
the
plan
carriers
serving
these
five
airports
have
been
asked
to
give
DOT
their
summer
1987
schedules
by
the
end
of
the
week
agency
will
then
review
the
schedules
and
decide
by
Monday
whether
they
threaten
to
cause
delays
so
airports
would
be
added
to
the
list
of
those
granted
wider
immunity
to
enable
scheduling
talks
said
she
was
confident
no
anticompetitive
effects
would
result
from
the
talks
she
said
would
be
monitored
by
U.S.
officials
and
would
be
open
