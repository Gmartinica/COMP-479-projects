CO-OP










Co-op programs
Co-operative Education is your link between the classroom and the world of work. Our program helps you put your learning to work by alternating full-time academic terms with full-time, paid work terms. We set you up for success with relevant seminars, courses, coaching and advising.  
Co-op students graduate with the kind of practical experience that today's employers are seeking – a combination of academic and real-world work experience, research knowledge and business acumen.
