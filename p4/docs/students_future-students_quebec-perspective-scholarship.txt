The Government of Quebec has introduced an incentive scholarship program, the Québec Perspective Scholarship Program, which is specifically aimed at essential public services and strategic areas of the economy where there is currently a labor shortage. The targeted areas are health and social services, education, educational childcare, information technology and engineering sectors.
Below you can see the programs that are eligible for this scholarship program at the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science.

Incentive scholarships are available to students in the relevant programs at a rate of $2,500 per successful full-time semester of study for a maximum of $15,000 for a three-year program and $20,000 for a four-year program.
Starting in the fall 2022 semester, Quebec students enrolled full-time in one of these programs will be eligible for scholarships, whether they are at the beginning, middle or end of their journey.
Scholarships will be awarded by the Government of Quebec after each successful full-time session.
Details regarding the procedure for submitting a scholarship application will be specified at a later date.
